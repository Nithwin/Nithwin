# GitHub Profile Makeover Plan

## 1. Goal & Vibe 🎯
To create a "meaningful and good looking" profile, I need to know your target audience and style preference.

**Question A: Who is this for?**
- [This one] Recruiters (Official, polished, resume-like)
- [This one as well ] Developers (Cool, technical, showing off code)
- [ ] Clients (Showcase of products and services)

**Question B: What is your preferred "Vibe"?**
- [ ] **Minimalist & Clean**: Lots of whitespace, simple black/white, very professional.
- [ ] **Cyber/Hacker**: Green/Black, terminal fonts, "Matrix" style (seems to be your current direction).
- [ ] **Modern/Glassmorphism**: Colorful gradients, translucent cards, very "2025 web design".
- [This] **Academic/Google**: Clean colors (Blue, Red, Yellow, Green), structured, very "Googley" since you mentioned Google SDE.

## 3. UI/Design Improvements 🎨
Here is what I plan to do based on your current profile:
1.  **Fix Duplicate Stats**: You have two sets of stats charts. I will consolidate them into one clean section.
2.  **Better Project Cards**: Instead of just text, we can use a table layout or visual banners if you have screenshots (or I can generate simple SVG banners).
3.  **Consistent Badges**: I will unify the badge style (currently some are `for-the-badge`, some mixed).
4.  **Banner**: The typing banner is okay, but I can make it cleaner or add a static high-quality header image.

**Question C: Do you want a "Snake" animation for your contribution graph?**
(This is a common cool feature for GitHub profiles)
- [yes] Yes
- [no] No

**Question D: Do you want "Spotify Playing Now" or similar widgets?**
- [yes] Yes
- [no] No
